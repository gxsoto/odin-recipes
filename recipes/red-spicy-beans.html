    <h3>What is This Plate?</h3>
    <p>Red spicy beans, a cherished staple of Mexican cuisine, embody a harmonious 
        blend of robust flavors and vibrant colors. These beans, typically pinto or
        kidney, are slow-cooked with aromatic spices, fiery chili peppers, and aromatic
        herbs, resulting in a rich and smoky dish with a kick of heat. Served alongside 
        fluffy rice, warm tortillas, and cooling toppings like fresh cilantro and tangy 
        crema, red spicy beans create a satisfying and comforting plate that reflects the 
        heart and soul of Mexican culinary tradition.</p>

    <!-- Step-by-Step -->
    <h3>The Process</h3>
    <h4>Preparing and Cooking the Beans:</h4>
    <p>To start the cooking process, ensure your beans are clean by giving them a thorough rinse. 
        Take a moment to check for any stray rocks, twigs, or leaves that may have found their way into
         the mix. After this initial cleaning, it's time to embark on the soaking process. Place the washed 
         beans in a pot and cover them with clean water. Allow them to soak overnight, or if time is limited, 
         you can expedite the process by placing chopped onions, salt, and garlic in the pot, covering it with 
         a lid, and bringing it to a boil.</p>
    <p>As the beans simmer, their flavors will meld and deepen. To ensure optimal results, cook them over low 
        heat for about 90 minutes to 2 hours. Keep in mind that cooking times can vary based on the type of beans
         and their dryness. Throughout the process, be vigilant about water levels; there should always be enough 
         liquid to cover the beans as they cook.</p>
    <h4>Testing Readiness:</h4>       
    <p>To determine if the beans are fully cooked, employ a simple test. Scoop up a couple of beans and gently blow
         on them. The skin should curl and wrinkle. After this test, taste one to confirm they're tender and thoroughly 
         cooked, while still retaining their structural integrity. Once they've reached this desirable consistency, allow
          the beans to cool in their cooking liquid, ensuring they continue to absorb the flavorful broth.</p>     
    <h4>Completion:</h4>
    <p>For an added layer of complexity, incorporate epazote, an aromatic herb that enhances the beans' earthy character. 
        Adding it just before removing the beans from the heat allows its essence to infuse the dish.</p>
