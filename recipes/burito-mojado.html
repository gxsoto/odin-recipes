    <!-- Step-by-Step -->
    <h3>The Process</h3>
    <h4>Making the Tomatillo Sauce:</h4>
    <p>Roasting tomatillos and green chile peppers to perfection, their charred notes harmonize with garlic,
         a pinch of sea salt, and a hint of Mexican oregano. These elements converge to create a vibrant, 
         zesty sauce that will infuse your burritos with traditional flair.</p>

    <h4>Marinating Chicken:</h4>
    <p>Infuse the meat with the earthy allure of ground cumin, the zing of fresh lime juice, and a sprinkle of sea 
        salt. Allow the marinated chicken to soak in these authentic flavors for a minimum of an hour before skillfully 
        grilling or pan-frying it to tender perfection, each bite offering a tantalizing blend of Mexican authenticity.</p>

    <h4>Assembling the Burrito</h4>
    <p> Gently warmed on a traditional comal or skillet, they provide the canvas for your culinary masterpiece. Begin by
         layering the tortilla with velvety refried pinto beans, each spoonful capturing the essence of comfort and tradition.
          On this foundation, arrange slices of marinated chicken, accompanied by the creamy decadence of Oaxaca cheese and a 
          scattering of cooked rice.</p>

    <h4>Marinating the Burrito and Baking:</h4>
    <p>With meticulous care, fold the sides of the tortilla and artfully roll it into a burrito, a labor of love that encapsulates 
        the authenticity of Mexican cuisine. Place these culinary treasures in a baking dish, where they eagerly await the 
        transformative touch of the flavorful green chile sauce. Pour this vibrant elixir generously over the burritos, ensuring 
        that every morsel is embraced by the beguiling symphony of tastes.</p>
    <p>Elevate the experience of each Green Chile Burrito by allowing them to bake until warmth infuses every bite and the flavors meld
         harmoniously. As these creations emerge from the oven, present them on plates as a homage to the heritage they represent. Drizzle
          crema, the Mexican sour cream, over the burritos for a luxurious touch that enhances the indulgence. Finally, awaken the senses 
          with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and a burst of lime juice, brightening the ensemble with the vibrant colors and flavors of 
          Mexico.</p>
