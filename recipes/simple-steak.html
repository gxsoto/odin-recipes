    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Fresh Parsley</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Reduced-Sodium Soy Sauce</li>

        <li>Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Step-by-Step -->
    <h3>The Process</h3>
    <p>Begin by crafting the sumptuous garlic butter sauce that will elevate your steak
        to extraordinary heights. In a small saucepan, melt a generous portion of butter 
        over medium-low heat. As the butter transforms into a golden liquid, introduce finely
         minced garlic, allowing its aroma to infuse the butter with its rich essence. Stir gently,
          ensuring the garlic doesn't brown too quickly.</p>
    <p>As the garlic begins to release its irresistible fragrance, finely chop a handful of fresh parsley
         leaves. Add them to the saucepan, letting their vibrant green color and herbal notes intermingle 
         with the buttery richness. This addition will lend a burst of freshness to balance the indulgent 
         flavors.</p>
    <p>To deepen the complexity of your garlic butter sauce, incorporate a dash of reduced-sodium soy sauce. 
        This umami-rich element will enhance the overall flavor profile, infusing a subtle depth that marries
         harmoniously with the other components. Stir gently to ensure a homogeneous blend.</p>
    <p>With your exquisite garlic butter sauce prepared, turn your attention to the star of the showâ€”the beef 
        steak. Whether you're opting for a hearty beef steak or a succulent boneless sirloin cut, ensure it's 
        at room temperature for even cooking. Generously season both sides with a pinch of salt and a sprinkle 
        of freshly ground black pepper, enhancing the natural flavors of the meat.</p>
    <p>In a preheated skillet or grill pan over high heat, place your seasoned steak. As it makes contact with 
        the sizzling surface, you'll hear the captivating sizzle that promises a mouthwatering sear. Allow the 
        steak to cook undisturbed for a few minutes on each side, depending on your preferred level of doneness. 
        For a medium-rare result, aim for about 4-5 minutes per side.</p>
    <p>During the last few minutes of cooking, unleash the magic of your garlic butter sauce. With a brush or spoon,
         generously baste the steak with the luxurious mixture, ensuring every nook and cranny is bathed in its 
         fragrant embrace. This step infuses the steak with the captivating flavors of garlic, butter, and herbs.</p>
    <p>As the steak reaches your desired level of doneness, remove it from the heat and allow it to rest for a few minutes. 
        This crucial step ensures the juices redistribute, resulting in a tender and juicy interior. Slice your masterpiece 
        against the grain to maximize tenderness, and serve it with a drizzle of any remaining garlic butter sauce, infusing 
        every bite with sheer decadence.</p>
    <p>Garnish your sliced steak with a final flourish of freshly chopped parsley for a visual pop that mirrors the flavors. 
        The tender meat, kissed by the savory garlic butter, will be a symphony of tastes and textures. Accompany your creation 
        with your preferred side dishes, whether it's a mound of buttery mashed potatoes, a vibrant salad, or a medley of grilled 
        vegetables.</p>
