    <!-- Step-by-Step -->
    <p> Begin by peeling off the husks of the tomatillos and giving them a good rinse. Chop them into quarters and gather 
        your other heroes of flavor: diced onion, velvety poblano pepper, and a touch of fiery jalapeño or serrano peppers. 
        Heat a spoonful of rich olive oil in a pan, then toss in your colorful veggies, letting them sizzle and soften. As 
        the aroma fills the air, introduce finely minced garlic for an aromatic hug.</p>
    <p>The star of the show, those zesty tomatillos, join the mix, along with a pinch of salt to coax out their juices. The
         transformation begins as the tomatillos gently simmer, yielding to their inherent tanginess. It's time to bring in 
         a handful of fresh cilantro to infuse a burst of herbal fragrance. Give everything a whirl in your blender or food 
         processor, adjusting the consistency with a splash of chicken stock if needed. Taste your creation, and if you're 
         feeling bold, a dash of black pepper can take the flavors to the next level. </p>    
    <p>Now that you have your enchanting tomatillo elixir, it's time to assemble the chilaquiles. For an authentic touch, cut 
        fresh tortillas into triangles and fry them until they're golden and crisped to perfection. If convenience is your game,
         store-bought tortilla chips are your trusty shortcut.</p>   
    <p>In a generous skillet, a drizzle of olive oil takes center stage. Nestle in your tortilla chips or the crispy triangles 
        you've crafted, letting them mingle and warm in the oil's embrace. Then comes the moment you've been waiting for: gently 
        pour your luscious tomatillo sauce over the chips, each one welcoming the vibrant embrace. A soft stir ensures every chip 
        is painted with that tangy coat, resulting in a harmonious blend of textures and tastes. </p>  
    <p>Feeling adventurous? Elevate your chilaquiles with a sprinkle of culinary charm—eggs! Create little pockets of opportunity 
        within the skillet, where eggs can nestle and cook into a creamy, golden delight. Cover the pan, and let the eggs perform 
        their culinary magic, the yolks reaching the desired level of oozy perfection.</p>  
    <p>The final crescendo involves crumbled queso fresco dancing atop the chilaquiles. This creamy addition enhances the layers of 
        flavor, playing harmoniously with the tangy tomatillo sauce. To balance the tang and creaminess, a generous drizzle of sour
         cream becomes the conductor of this culinary symphony.</p>    
    <p>A shower of chopped cilantro lends a burst of freshness, and a sprinkle of black pepper adds the finishing touch, subtly coaxing
         out the flavors that have united in this dish.</p>
