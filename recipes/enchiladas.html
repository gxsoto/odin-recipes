    <!-- Step-by-Step -->
    <p>The foundation of these Enchiladas Verdes is a luscious chicken filling. Begin by poaching boneless, skinless 
        chicken breasts in a pot of flavorful chicken stock. This poaching process ensures that the chicken remains tender 
        and juicy. Once cooked, shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces using two forks.</p>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded chicken with a velvety cream cheese filling. The cream cheese adds a delightful
         creaminess and depth of flavor. To elevate the taste, sprinkle in a pinch of salt, a dash of paprika for a smoky note, 
         a touch of cumin to infuse warmth, and a hint of pepper to balance the flavors. Give everything a good mix until the 
         filling is well-incorporated and the seasonings are evenly distributed.</p>
    <p> Boil the tomatillos until they're soft and vibrant in color. Blend them into a smooth puree, adding sautéed white onion, 
        minced garlic, and a fresh kick of jalapeño. Toss in a handful of fragrant cilantro to brighten up the mixture. The result
        is a zesty, vibrant sauce that's the soul of these enchiladas.</p>
    <p>With your filling and sauce prepared, it's time to bring your enchiladas to life. Warm corn tortillas on a skillet to make 
        them pliable. Spoon a generous helping of the creamy chicken filling onto each tortilla, roll them up, and place them seam-side
         down in a baking dish. The tortillas become cozy nests for the flavorful filling.</p>
    <p>Ladle the tangy tomatillo sauce generously over the enchiladas, ensuring they're all embraced by its zesty charm. As a final touch, 
        sprinkle any cheese of your choice over the top. The cheese will melt and create a golden crust that's utterly irresistible.</p>
    <p>Slide the baking dish into the oven, allowing the enchiladas to bake until the cheese is bubbly and golden. The aroma wafting through 
        your kitchen will tease your senses, and your anticipation will grow with every passing minute.</p>
    <p>As you take the enchiladas out of the oven, the sight is a feast for the eyes—golden enchiladas crowned with a melty cheese crust, resting
         in a pool of vibrant green tomatillo sauce. Let them cool slightly before serving. As the first bite makes contact, the tortilla yields 
         to the tender filling, the tangy sauce embraces your taste buds, and the cheese imparts a richness that ties everything together.</p>
    <p>For an added layer of indulgence, serve your Enchiladas Verdes with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro. The cool 
        creaminess and herbal freshness are the perfect accompaniments to the robust flavors.</p>
