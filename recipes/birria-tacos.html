    <!-- Step-by-Step -->
    <h3>The Process</h3>
    <h4>Barbacoa:</h4>
    <p>Start by preparing the barbacoa. Begin by soaking the dried guajillo peppers in hot water for about 15 minutes
         until they soften. Once they're softened, drain the water and remove the seeds from the peppers. In a blender, 
         combine the soaked guajillo peppers, garlic, roughly chopped white onion, cumin, oregano, salt, and water. Blend 
         these ingredients until they form a smooth sauce.</p>

    <p>Next, take the chunks of chuck roast and place them in a slow cooker or a pot. Pour the guajillo pepper sauce over 
        the meat, ensuring that it's well-coated. Add the bay leaves to the pot and give everything a good mix, ensuring the 
        flavors are evenly distributed. Now, it's time to let the barbacoa cook. Set your slow cooker to low heat and let the 
        meat cook for 6 to 8 hours, or until it becomes tender enough to easily shred.</p>  
    
    <h4>Short Ribs:</h4>  
    <p>As the barbacoa cooks, you can move on to preparing the short ribs. Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). In a small bowl,
         mix together the chili powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper to create a spice rub. Take the short ribs and rub this mixture
          all over them, ensuring that they're evenly coated.</p>  

    <p>Place the seasoned short ribs in an oven-safe dish and cover the dish with aluminum foil. This will help keep the moisture in while
         the ribs cook. Roast the ribs in the preheated oven for approximately 2.5 to 3 hours. You'll know they're ready when the meat becomes 
         tender and easily pulls apart with a fork.</p>    

    <h4>Carrot Corn Salsa:</h4>    
    <p>While the barbacoa and short ribs are cooking, you can prepare the carrot-corn salsa. In a bowl, combine the finely diced carrots, finely 
        diced white onion, cooked corn, lime juice, and olive oil. Give the mixture a good stir to ensure all the ingredients are well-mixed. To 
        add a touch of flavor, season the salsa with salt and pepper according to your taste preferences. Set the salsa aside for later.</p> 
    
    <h4>Assembly:</h4> 
    <p>Begin by warming the corn tortillas. You can do this in a dry skillet or in the microwave until they're pliable and easy to work with.</p>   
    <p>To assemble each taco, place a generous amount of the barbacoa and shredded short rib meat onto a warm corn tortilla. Top the meat with 
        finely chopped white onion, shredded quesadilla cheese, and a sprinkling of fresh cilantro for a burst of flavor. Add a spoonful of the 
        carrot-corn salsa on top to add a refreshing crunch and additional taste.</p> 
    <p>For an extra kick of flavor, squeeze a wedge of lime over each taco. If desired, you can dissolve a bit of chicken bouillon in warm water and 
        drizzle it over the barbacoa and short rib meat for added richness.</p>   
    <p>Arrange the assembled tacos on a serving platter and offer extra lime wedges on the side for those who want an extra zing. Now, you're all set 
        to enjoy your delicious Barrio Tacos filled with the rich flavors of barbacoa, succulent short ribs, and vibrant toppings.</p>
